/*
* 1. image!.openRead()
image is a File (you created it from File(pickedFile.path)).

.openRead() is a method from the File class in dart:io.

It opens the file as a stream of bytes â€” a way to read it chunk by chunk (efficient for big files like images).

âœ… It returns a Stream<List<int>>.

ðŸ§¯ 2. http.ByteStream(...)
This wraps the byte stream into a format that the http package can use.

dart
Copy
Edit
http.ByteStream(image!.openRead())
This creates a special stream (ByteStream) needed for sending file data to the server using MultipartFile.

âœ… So far: You created a file stream in the format HTTP understands.
